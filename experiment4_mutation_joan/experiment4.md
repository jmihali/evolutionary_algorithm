This experiment aims to test mutation. As in the previous experiment, for the testing I used the following multivariate test function, 
called Alpine 2 Function, with n = 5 dimensions:

- <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? f(\mathbf x)=f(x_1, ..., x_n) = \prod_{i=1}^{n}\sqrt{x_i}sin(x_i) " />

The global minimum is located at xâˆ—= (7.917, ... , 7.917), f(x*) = 2.808^n.
Throughout the experiment, the following options are kept fixed:

```python
DIMENSIONS = 5
population size = 200
generations = 20
toolbox.register('attr_float', random.uniform, 0, 10)
toolbox.register('select', tools.selTournament, tournsize=3)
CXPB = 0.0
```

## Testing Polynomial Mutation
Parameters to fix:

Observation: Similarly to the Gaussian mutation, increasing the variance of the mutation leads to a more effective
optimization, because you introduce more variety to the population.

Having a super high or a super low variance are both bad. In the first case, good solutions are destroyed. In the latter,
there will be no diversity.

## Testing Shuffle Indexes mutation

Performs poorly for this optimization problem. In another kind of problem it should perform well (e.g. 'find the
permutation of M different symbols that has the best fitness')
